Eventually, there will be documentation. For now, use the tests as examples or read through the (as-yet incomplete) tutorial.

To read through all the tutorials, write the program

```racket
#lang racket
(require pict3d/tutorials)
```

To read through just one, write a program like

```racket
#lang racket
(require pict3d/tutorial/00)
```

To open the test files, in DrRacket, click the "File -> Open Require Path..." menu item. Type "pict3d/tests" (without the quotes), and click "Enter subcollection", choose a Racket source file, and click "OK".
